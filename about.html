        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
            HELL INTERFACING is a collective of internet musicians who spontaneously decided to 
            form this group so as to allow cataloging all of our work under one proper netlabel 
            which is ours and ours only.
        </p>
        <h2>How did this come to be?</h2>
        <p>
            Sort of inspired by the now-defunct Mind Waltz which was cofounded by our member 
            Vivian Gee, the idea was to simply have an overarching umbrella term for our releases 
            which we can refer to in an organized order. 
        </p>
        <h2>What does the future hold?</h2>
        <p>
            Pretty hard to tell, actually, as we are not approaching this very seriously as a 
            proper label would be managed. There are some ambitious plans that we are daydreaming 
            about and there's active work going into allocating more attention and resources to 
            this project.
            With that being said, we DO have something label-related that we've started working on 
            and I'm personally very excited to see how that turns out.
        </p>
        <h2>Is the name a Boards of Canada reference?</h2>
        <p>
            Yes.
        </p>
        <h2>Why is this site so dogshit?</h2>
        <p>
            I don't know how to do soywebdev and I deeply despise J*vaScript.
        </p>
        <h2>Do you expect anyone to actively care?</h2>
        <p>
            Not necessarily. It'd be nice, but with the way things are in the netscapes with the 
            incessant desire of everyone wanting that bit of attention and relevance, one has to 
            practice doing things primarily for themselves. In a way that's our way of thinking 
            with this label.
        </p>

            Thank you for stopping by and I hope you found what we interesting (or deeply naive!)
